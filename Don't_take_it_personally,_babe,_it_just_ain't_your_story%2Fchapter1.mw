You should note that in addition to your own personal things — as part of our ongoing trial with giving students their own computers — you will be able to access all your students' social networking messages sent across our AmieConnect system, both public and private.\n\nMost teachers have found this to be an extremely effective way of monitoring online bullying; pragmatically, it's impossible to stop students from chatting in class, but you can at least be on top of it! There would be serious repercussions if the students ever found out, though, so please be discreet.\n\nLet me just welcome you again to Lake City Academy. You seem like an excellent teacher, and I'm sure will make a fine member of our team. Good luck!\n\nSincerely,\n\nMalcolm Grisham\nPrincipal")
